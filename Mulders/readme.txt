Planet Catalog: Q1-Q16 SOC 9.1

Star Catalog: Huber et al. 2014


Filters: 
- Removed giant stars according to prescription in Ciardi et al. 2011 (logg < 3.5-4.0 depending on Teff)



Compeleteness Model:  

- Calculated as described in Mulders et al. 2015 ApJ 814:130 (Some details of the method can be found in Mulders et al. 
2015 ApJ 798:112)

- Completeness as function of S/N from Christiansen et al. 2015 ApJ 810 95

- Assumed orbital eccentricity of 0.1

- Not taking into account false positives



Methodology:  

- Non-parametric

- Direct Calculation (i.e. Inverse Detection Efficiency) 

- statistical uncertainties only: sqrt(n)

- NaN's assigned to bins with zero planet candidates



NOTE: indices don't start at 1, as indicated in the header.
