Interpolated occurrence rate analysis of Foreman-Mackey, Hogg, & Morton (2014) MAC14

The results given in eta_g.txt are from Figure 5 of MAC14 are

reinterpolated to the standard SAG13 period radius bins by Christopher

Burke.  The method fits a local power-law model to the reported bins

given in the figure.  Then the local power-law is used to interpolate

onto a different grid that crosses native grid boundaries.  This

process is partially explained in Sec. 7 Par. 4 of Burke et al. (2015)

The results in Figure 5 were obtained from

via the link on the companion github repository in support of the paper.

The binned results are samples of the population density over all stars.

Thus, for the table I converted the tabulated population density by multiplying by the 
ln(planet radius bin size) and ln(period bin size) and dividing by the number of stars, N*=42557.

The data table starts with the normal radius and period indices range from 1<iRp<8 and 1<iP<6, respectively.
