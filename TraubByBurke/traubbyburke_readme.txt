Completeness Model:

-Detection efficiency versus MES model from Christiansen et al. (2016)

-Detection efficiency model is different for P<100 day and P>100 day

     according to model parameters from Christiansen et al. (2016)

-Additional detection efficiency cut requirment for SNR > 7.1



Vetting Efficiency:

- Assumed 100% 



Reliability:

- Assume 100% reliability



Methodology:

-Parametric broken power-law model with a break in period and planet radius

-Binned comparison between model and observed counts



Integrated occurrence rates of Traub (2016) TRA16

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160502255T



The results given in eta_X.txt are based upon integrating the 

broken power-law model for planet occurrence rates from TRA16.

The model parameters are for the GKM dwarf targets in Table 4 Q1-17 catalog



The Gdwarf and Kdwarf data table uses planet radius indices 1<iRp<8 and period indices 1<iP<6.

The Mdwarf data tables has planet radius indices 1<iRp<4 and period indices 1<iP<4
