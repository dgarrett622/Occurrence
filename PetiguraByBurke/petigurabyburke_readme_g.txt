Interpolated occurrence rate analysis of Petigura, Howard, & Marcy (2013) PET13

The results given in eta_g.txt are from Figure 2 of PET13 are

reinterpolated to the standard SAG13 period radius bins by Christopher

Burke.  The method fits a local power-law model to the reported bins

given in the figure.  Then the local power-law is used to interpolate

onto a different grid that crosses native grid boundaries.  This

process is partially explained in Sec. 7 Par. 4 of Burke et al. (2015)

The data table starts with modified radius indices range from 2<iRp<8 and normal period indices 1<iP<6.
