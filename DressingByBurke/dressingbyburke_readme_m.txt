Interpolated occurrence rate analysis of Dressing & Charbonneau (2015) DRE15

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...807...45D


The results given in eta_m.txt are from Figure 12 of DRE15 are

reinterpolated to the standard SAG13 period radius bins by Christopher

Burke.  The method fits a local power-law model to the reported bins

given in the figure.  Then the local power-law is used to interpolate

onto a different grid that crosses native grid boundaries.  This

process is partially explained in Sec. 7 Par. 4 of Burke et al. (2015)

The data table starts with the normal radius and period indices range from 1<iRp<8 and 1<iP<6, respectively.
